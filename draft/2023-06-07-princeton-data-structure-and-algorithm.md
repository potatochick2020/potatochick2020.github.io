![250 Leetcode Question](/assets/img/self-study/princeton%20algorithms/leetcode-250q.PNG)
After completing roughly 250 Leetcode problems, I realized that my foundation in Data Structures and Algorithms was weak because I had never studied the subject systematically. To address this issue, I found an online course from Princeton University that had received high ratings for its challenging projects and comprehensive curriculum. Although the course primarily uses Java, the principles of Data Structures and Algorithms are universal and not dependent on any specific programming language.

## Week 1 : Union Find 

This week talk about Union find, sadly, the course provide a WeightedQuickUnionUF Library which I did not code my own union find but only using the one provided by the library. I would say this week lab is really easy and provide some  simple practise on java language, such as throwing an exception or primative type and

## Week 2 : Queue 

This Week is a bit fun compare to last week Union Find project. First, we need to create a deque, I used the doubly linkedlist with null head and tail initialize method. 

The next part of the project is to create a randomizedQueue, basically just a linked-list with few more features related to random, nothing really special.
