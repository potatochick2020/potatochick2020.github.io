## Smart Goal 定義 | Definations

- Specific – target a specific area for improvement.
- Measurable – quantify or at least suggest an indicator of progress.
- Assignable – specify who will do it.
- Realistic – state what results can realistically be achieved, given available resources.
- Time-related – specify when the result(s) can be achieved.

## 反SMART Goal (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-Bound goal) | Anti - S.M.A.R.T Goals

我原本都會訂立唔少目標，由運動，讀書，甚至coding都會有唔少目標。但自從我持續咁寫左一年半code之後（係18歲之前嘅人生基本上每一項學習都係半途而廢），我發現其實一年半之前訂立嘅目標其實太離地。分析完之後發現其實一年半之前嘅我并不清楚訂立嘅目標對於自己黎講有幾咁困難，又或者其實完成左呢堆目標之後並唔代表任何野。

擧個例，如果我訂立左為左成爲一個優秀嘅SWE，我要係一年内完成100條leetcode。但其實操過LC之後會發現LC并不能夠幫助自己成爲更優秀嘅SWE，而且100題其實唔算得係咩。

另一個壞處係因爲自己缺乏對於目標嘅理解而訂立一個太難嘅目標會容易造成挫敗感，打擊自己嘅自信心。

I would have set a lot of goals, from sports, reading, and even coding. But since I continued to write code for a year and a half (basically every study in my life before the age of 18 was abandoned halfway), I found that the goals set a year and a half ago were actually too far away. After the analysis, I found that a year and a half ago, I didn't know how difficult the goals I set were for me, or that it didn't mean anything after completing the left pile of goals.

For example, if I make an agreement to become an excellent SWE from left to left, I need to complete 100 leetcodes within one year. But in fact, after practicing LC, you will find that LC cannot help you become a better SWE, and 100 questions is actually not a big deal.

Another disadvantage is that setting a goal that is too difficult because of a lack of understanding of the goal will easily cause frustration and damage one's self-confidence.

## 解決辦法 | Solution - direction oriented task scheduling principle (我亂作的)

首先訂立一個方向，例如係，“我要體能好d”，而唔係一個SMART目標，“我要係一年後可以在一個鐘頭内跑到15km”，然後在思考有咩會幫助到令自己更接近呢個方向，例如跑步，做引體上升，行山。盡量唔好訂立一個regular routine要自己每隔一段時間要做一次，因爲一有其他野忙，就好容易skip一次兩次之後唔做，最後係自己空餘時間塞呢d task入去做。

First set a direction, for example, "I want to be physically fit", instead of a SMART goal, "I want to be able to run 15km in one hour after one year", and then think about what will help you It is closer to this direction, such as running, doing pull-ups, and hiking. Try not to set up a regular routine that requires you to do it every once in a while, because once you have other busy schedules, it is easy to skip once or twice and then not do it, and finally fill in the d task in your spare time to do it.

### 適合用的場合 | Suitable scenario 

一定要自己從心而發想去acheive嘅嘢，例如成爲一個更優秀嘅工程師，擁有健康嘅體魄，更吸引的身形。

Be sure to acheive from the heart, such as becoming a better engineer, having a healthy body, and a more attractive body shape.
