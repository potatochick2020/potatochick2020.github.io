# Background
After using nvim for couple month, I am quite comfortable to move between text within the text editor. But I find myself being quite strange in terminal. Therefore, here is a small research on basic movement in linux terminal

# Navigate to start/end of line  
```
<C-A> for start , equivalent of _ in vim
<C-E> for end , equivalent of $ in vim
```

# Navigate to previous/next word
```
<A-B> for previous word , equivalent to b in vim
<A-F> for next word, equivalent to w in vim

# Delete 
```
<C-U> for delete until start of line, equivalent to d_ in vim
<C-K> for delete until end of line, equivalent to d$ in vim
```
